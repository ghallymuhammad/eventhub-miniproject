## Database Integration Points

When connecting to a real database, the following data flows need API integration:

1. **User Authentication**: Sign up, sign in, session management
2. **Event Management**: CRUD operations for events and ticket types  
3. **Transaction Processing**: Payment tracking and status updates
4. **File Upload**: Payment proof and event image storage
5. **Real-time Updates**: Transaction status, seat availability
6. **Review System**: Post-event review collection and display
7. **Analytics**: Dashboard metrics and reporting
8. **Notification System**: Email alerts and in-app notifications

The DBML schema provides the complete database structure needed to support all these user flows.
